That's me, **Silvia de Sojo**.   
I am a PhD student at the [Technical  University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/)  
Originally from *Barcelona*  
Living in *Copenhaguen*

My PhD focuses on the **Gender Gap in Human Mobility** and my goal is quantify the gender differences in travel behavior across countries, age-groups, and socio-economic groups world-wide using high-resolution data; and identify the factors driving the observed differences.  

My PhD supervisors are [Laura Alessandretti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2265XuYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Sune Lehmann](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wvkUbiUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).


Before my PhD, I studied a Master's in [Business Analytics](https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/graduate/msc-programmes/Business-Analytics) and specialized in Predictive Analytics. I have a Bachelor in [Industrial Engineering](https://www.upc.edu/en). I have experience in the industry sector having worked for [HP Inc](https://www.hp.com/us-en/home.html) and [United Nations Development Program](https://www.undp.org/).

I am interested in Computational Social Science, Data Science and Complex Networks. My objective is to study human behavior combining analysis of large-scale datasets, analytical models and numerical simulations.
