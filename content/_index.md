I am a PhD student at the Social Complexity Lab in the [Technical  University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/), and a visiting researcher at [Senseable City Lab](https://senseable.mit.edu/).

Originally from Barcelona, based in Copenhagen, and currently living in Boston.  
<!-- <br /><br /> -->
My research focuses on understanding behavioral inequalities across genders and diverse groups. 
In my PhD, I study the **The Gender Gaps in Human Mobility**. My goal is to quantify the gender differences in travel behavior and to identify the factors driving the observed differences.  
<!-- My PhD supervisors are [Laura Alessandretti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2265XuYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Sune Lehmann](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wvkUbiUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

Before my PhD, I studied a Master's in [Business Analytics](https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/graduate/msc-programmes/Business-Analytics) and a Bachelor in [Industrial Engineering](https://www.upc.edu/en). I have experience in the industry sector having worked for [HP Inc](https://www.hp.com/us-en/home.html) and [United Nations Development Program](https://www.undp.org/).

I am interested in Computational Social Science, Data Science and Complex Networks. My objective is to study human behavior combining analysis of large-scale datasets, analytical models and numerical simulations.
