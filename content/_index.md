Hello there, thanks for passing by. 

I am Silvia de Sojo a PhD student at the [Technical  University of Denmark - DTU Compute](https://www.dtu.dk/) with supervisors [Laura Alessandretti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2265XuYAAAAJ&hl=en) and  [Sune Lehmann](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wvkUbiUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)

My PhD focuses on the **Gender Gap in Human Mobility** and my goal is quantify the gender differences in travel behavior across countries, age-groups, and socio-economic groups world-wide using high-resolution data; and identify the factors driving the observed differences.

I am interested in Computational Social Science, Data Science and Complex Networks. I research aspects of human behavior combining analysis of large-scale datasets, analytical models and numerical simulations.
