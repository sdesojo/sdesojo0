<!-- # Modelling Human Mobility

 ## PhD Project Objective


## Master Thesis

Recent studies have unveiled the gender gap in human mobility, with women day-to-day travel behaviour differing from that of men. However, the scientific understanding of the factors driving gender differences in travel patterns is limited due to the lack of suitable data. 

The gender division of labour and household responsibilities have been proposed as a possible explanation for the observed gap in mobility. Nevertheless, these hypotheses have not been investigated at scale. 

My first research objective is to quantify and describe the gender differences in mobility behaviour and tests if the division of labour can partly explain the gender disparities. To achieve this goal, we split the analysis into (i) Identify how employment influences the gender gap in mobility, (ii) Determine how demographic features explain individuals’ entropy.

We use a novel pseudo-anonymized and GDPR-compliant dataset containing multiyear GPS traces of half a million individuals and demographics. The gender differences in mobility are studied by computing the number of visits, the duration of stops, and predictability. To study the
division of labour’s effect, we first estimate the individual employment status from the mobility data using heuristic algorithms.

During the development of my master theiss we identifed that the gender gap in mobility appears regardless of the employment status. However, an individual’s employment status strongly affects their mobility behaviour and impacts the observed gender differences in travel patterns. Furthermore, we find a complex interrelation between demographic features and conclude that it is not possible to explain the
gender gap in mobility with a single demographic feature.
